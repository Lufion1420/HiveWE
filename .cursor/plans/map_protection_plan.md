# Map Protection Tool — Implementation Plan

**Project:** HiveWE Fork
**Feature:** Map Protection Window (standalone export-only tool, opens from main ribbon)
**Status:** Implemented — Phase 1, all of Phase 2 except object-field stripping (see "What shipped vs. what's deferred" below). Verified in-game: protected output no longer opens in the stock World Editor and still plays correctly. `strip_trigger_strings`'s first real in-game test (this session) found and fixed a real bug — see "Session notes" below — and still needs a fresh in-game re-test with the fix applied before it's fully trusted.
**Last updated:** 2026-08-05

For a session-by-session account of *how* this got built (bugs found, why certain approaches were chosen), see `map_protection_handoff.md`. This doc describes the current, as-built state.

---

## Overview

A **Map Protector** window (ribbon: Config section) that lets the user configure a set of protection transforms, then exports either the currently-loaded map or an arbitrary external map file/folder as a new, separate `.w3x`. The source is never modified. The protected output runs in Warcraft III but is resistant to being opened, decompiled, or edited in world editors.

---

## Architecture (as built)

Diverges from the original draft in two ways worth knowing before editing this feature:

- **File layout**: `protection_pipeline.ixx` is a single C++20 module, not a `.h`/`.cpp` split — matches this repo's module convention (see `.cursor/rules/hivewe-cpp-modules.mdc`).
- **Source selection**: the window has a "Source" group with two mutually exclusive options:
  - **Currently loaded map** — routes through `run_sync_save_and_restore()`, which calls the live `map->save(temp_dir)` (HiveWE's full save, regenerating triggers/script from HiveWE's own state). Correct for protecting the live editor session.
  - **Map file or folder** (external) — routes through `prepare_source_path()`, which copies a folder-mode source or unpacks a `.w3x`/`.w3m` source directly into the temp folder **without ever loading it into HiveWE's `Map` object**. This exists because routing everything through `Map::save()` would silently regenerate `war3map.j`/`war3map.lua` from HiveWE's own trigger state, corrupting maps built by external tooling (e.g. a compiled Lua script from another build pipeline). Metadata sanitization for this path uses a standalone `MapInfo` instance instead of `map->info`.

Both paths converge on the same `run_async_pack()` step (background thread, StormLib packing).

### Files
```
src/map_protector/
  map_protector.h            — QMainWindow subclass (the window)
  map_protector.cpp          — UI logic, settings, export trigger
  protection_pipeline.ixx    — ProtectionOptions + both save paths + packing (single module)
```

### Prerequisite fix: opening real `.w3x` archives

`HiveWE::load_mpq()` (`hivewe.cpp`) and `MPQ::unpack()` (`src/file_formats/mpq.ixx`) previously failed silently on archives without a `(listfile)`: StormLib's wildcard enumeration still finds every entry, but unnamed ones come back under fabricated names (`File00001234.blp`) instead of the real ones, so the unpacked folder ended up missing `war3map.w3i` and failed to load. This mattered directly for Map Protector, since its own "Remove listfile" option produces exactly this kind of archive — there was no way to open/verify a protected map's own output. Fixed by also fetching the fixed set of core `war3map.*` files directly by name via the new `MPQ::extract_file()` (MPQ looks files up by name hash, not directory listing, so this works with or without a listfile). `unpack_source_archive()` in `protection_pipeline.ixx` reuses this same fix for the external-source path.

Known limitation (expected, not a bug): custom-imported assets under non-core names (e.g. `war3mapImported\Something.mdx`) still can't be recovered under their real relative path from a listfile-less archive — there's no fixed name list to fall back on for arbitrary imports. This is exactly what removing the listfile is supposed to achieve.

---

## UI (as built)

Window title: **Map Protector**, `QMainWindow`, resizes from 700×560.

1. **Source** — `Currently loaded map` / `Map file or folder:` radio buttons; the latter enables a path field + `Browse File...` / `Browse Folder...` buttons.
2. **Output file** — path field + `Browse...`. Defaults next to the source map's own folder (not the app-wide "last opened directory" setting, which can point at an unrelated/stale location).
3. **MPQ Archive Hardening** — Remove listfile (default ON), Remove attributes file (ON), Encrypt MPQ files (ON), Inject junk files (OFF) + junk file count spinner (default 50, enabled only when the checkbox is on).
4. **Trigger / Script Hardening** — Remove GUI trigger data (ON) — deletes `war3map.wtg`. Strip trigger strings (OFF) — inlines `war3map.wts` text into the script, then deletes `war3map.wts`.
5. **Metadata Sanitization** — Clear map author / description / loading screen text / normalize map name (all OFF by default).
6. **Action bar** — status label, indeterminate progress bar, `Export Protected Map` button.

All options persist via `QSettings` (group `"MapProtector"`).

---

## `ProtectionOptions` (as built, `protection_pipeline.ixx`)

```cpp
struct ProtectionOptions {
    // MPQ archive hardening
    bool remove_listfile = true;
    bool remove_attributes = true;
    bool encrypt_files = true;
    bool inject_junk_files = false;
    int junk_file_count = 50;

    // Trigger hardening
    bool remove_gui_triggers = true;
    bool strip_trigger_strings = false;

    // Metadata sanitization
    bool clear_author = false;
    bool clear_description = false;
    bool clear_loading_text = false;
    bool normalize_name = false;
};
```

## Export flow (as built)

```
User clicks "Export Protected Map"
  → MapProtector::on_export_clicked()
  → Validate source (loaded map, or existing external path) and output path
  → Disable options, show progress bar
  → Synchronously, on the UI thread:
        run_sync_save_and_restore(temp_dir, options)   [current map]
        or prepare_source_path(source, temp_dir, options)  [external source]
  → On success, background via QThread::create():
        run_async_pack(temp_dir, output_path, options)
  → QMetaObject::invokeMethod(..., Qt::QueuedConnection) back to
    MapProtector::on_export_finished(result) on the UI thread
  → Re-enable options, hide progress bar, update status label
```

The sync-save step *must* run on the UI thread before backgrounding: both `run_sync_save_and_restore()` and `prepare_source_path()`'s metadata step briefly redirect the global `hierarchy.map_directory`, and `Map::save()`/`MapInfo::save()` aren't safe to call off the UI thread. Only the packing step (pure file I/O on the temp folder) is backgrounded.

## What shipped vs. what's deferred

### Implemented (Phase 1 + Phase 2 except object-field stripping)
- Remove listfile / remove attributes
- Remove GUI trigger data (`war3map.wtg`)
- **Strip trigger strings** — inlines `war3map.wts` TRIGSTR references directly into `war3map.j`/`war3map.lua`, then deletes `war3map.wts`. Implementation notes:
  - Researched (not guessed) how WC3 actually resolves TRIGSTR: a string value is recognized as a reference if it *starts with* `TRIGSTR_` followed by digits — trailing characters after the digits are accepted but ignored by the engine (e.g. `TRIGSTR_7abc` still resolves to trigger string #7). Matching is on that prefix+digits rule, not a stricter exact-string match.
  - `find_string_literals()` scans the script text for `"..."` literals, skipping both JASS (`//`, `/* */`) and Lua (`--`, `--[[ ]]`) comment styles so a quote inside a comment can't desynchronize detection of literals after it. Respects `\"`/`\\` so an escaped quote doesn't end a literal early.
  - `escape_script_string()` handles the shared JASS/Lua escape set needed here: `\\`, `\"`, `\n` (WC3 itself uses the literal 2-character sequence `|n`, not a real newline byte, for in-tooltip line breaks — but trigger string *text* can still legitimately contain a real newline byte if a user pasted multi-line text into a WTS field, so this is handled, not assumed away).
  - Fails the whole export (does not silently ship a partially-resolved script) if a detected reference has no matching `war3map.wts` entry — a dangling reference would otherwise become unrecoverable text once the string table is deleted.
  - **Scope limitation, disclosed in the UI tooltip**: this only patches the script. Object data fields (e.g. a very long custom unit tooltip) can *independently* store a `TRIGSTR_XXX` reference too — those are not patched, since doing so would require loading the full SLK/meta tables the external-source path deliberately avoids touching. If a map relies on this, that specific field will show raw `TRIGSTR_034`-style text in-game after stripping.
  - All of the above (padding normalization, comment-skipping for both languages, escaping, and the fail-on-dangling-reference behavior) was validated with a standalone 22-case test against realistic sample script text before shipping — see git history for `protection_pipeline.ixx` around the commit that added this. **Not yet confirmed in a real Warcraft III client** — do that before trusting it on a real map.
- Metadata clearing (author / description / loading text / name) — via a standalone `MapInfo` instance for external sources, so this never requires loading the source into HiveWE's `Map` object
- Per-file MPQ encryption (`MPQ_FILE_ENCRYPTED`) — the same technique real-world map protectors use; WC3 decrypts per-file-encrypted archive contents transparently
- Junk file injection (configurable count, random name/extension/content)
- Protecting either the live in-editor map or an arbitrary external `.w3x`/`.w3m`/folder

### Deliberately deferred — not in `ProtectionOptions`, no UI
- **`strip_unused_fields`** (drop object-data fields the World Editor uses but the engine doesn't read at runtime) — blocked on: no such classification exists anywhere in this codebase, in WC3's shipped meta files, or (checked via web research) in any community source found so far. The `useHero`/`useUnit`/`useItem`/`useBuilding` SLK columns only indicate which editor tab a field appears on, not whether the engine reads it. Misclassifying even one field risks silently breaking unit/item/ability behavior with no safety net. Revisit only if a genuinely authoritative field-usage list turns up.
- **`remove_script_source`** (delete `war3map.wct`) — not implemented, not currently planned.

### Phase 3 (optional, complex — unchanged from original assessment, not started)
- JASS/Lua variable name obfuscation (would need a proper tokenizer — see `src/trigger_editor/jass_tokenizer.h`)
- Custom object ID remapping (would need to update every cross-reference in triggers/initialization code)

---

## Verified

- **Build**: `cmake --build --preset Release` (app + tests) — clean, no errors. Two pre-existing, unrelated `AutoMoc` warnings (`tooltip_editor`) are the only warnings.
- **Tests**: same pre-existing baseline (23 passed / 5 failed — unrelated failures in `object_data_io_test`/`mdl_reader_test`, predate this feature) — no regression.
- **In-game**: a map protected via Map Protector (a) no longer opens in the stock World Editor, (b) plays correctly in Warcraft III. Confirmed for the external-source path specifically with encryption + junk files enabled together.
- **Not yet in-game tested**: `strip_trigger_strings` with this session's fix applied (see "Session notes" below) — needs a fresh real-client run before it's fully trusted.

---

## Session notes (2026-08-05, second session)

First real in-game test of `strip_trigger_strings` surfaced a bug: the map's protected name and loading screen text both went blank in-game, even with every "Metadata Sanitization" checkbox left unchecked.

- **Root cause:** confirmed directly from the user's actual map's on-disk `war3map.w3i` — `loading_screen_text` was literally the string `"TRIGSTR_001"` and `loading_screen_title` was `"TRIGSTR_002"`. These `war3map.w3i` fields aren't always literal text; the World Editor writes a `TRIGSTR_XXX` placeholder when a field is set via a localized/custom-text string picker, resolved against `war3map.wts` at display time — same mechanism as script string literals. `strip_trigger_strings_step()` deleted `war3map.wts` after patching only `war3map.j`/`war3map.lua`, never touching `war3map.w3i`, so any TRIGSTR-based `name`/`author`/`description`/loading-screen field in it went dangling. This is a separate code path from "Metadata Sanitization", which is why toggling those checkboxes had no effect.
- **Fix:** added `inline_map_info_trigger_strings()` to `protection_pipeline.ixx` — resolves TRIGSTR references in `war3map.w3i`'s `name`/`author`/`description`/`loading_screen_text`/`loading_screen_title`/`loading_screen_subtitle` fields (via a standalone `MapInfo` instance, same tileset-byte-from-`war3map.w3e` technique as `sanitize_metadata()`) using the same parsed `war3map.wts` table already built for script patching. Called from `strip_trigger_strings_step()` right before `war3map.wts` is deleted; fails (aborts, doesn't delete wts) on a dangling reference, same as the script-patching path.
- **Separately found and fixed:** the output filename always defaulted to the *currently loaded* HiveWE map's name (`map->name`), even when protecting an unrelated external file/folder — and once any export had ever run, the field was pre-filled from a persisted `QSettings` value, so `populate_default_output_path()`'s empty-field check silently skipped recomputing it forever after. Fixed in `map_protector.cpp`/`.h`: added `default_output_base_name()` (derives from the actual selected source — `source_path_edit`'s file/folder stem for an external source, `map->name` only when "currently loaded map" is selected), stopped persisting `outputPath` in `QSettings`, and wired `populate_default_output_path()` to re-run on source-radio/source-path changes (tracked via a new `auto_generated_output_path` member so a manually-typed path is never clobbered).
- **Not changed this session:** full filename obfuscation (renaming every packed file, including imports, to garbage names the way classic-era map protectors did) — discussed with the user but not implemented. See note below.

### Asset path obfuscation — Phase 0 + Phase 1 shipped (2026-08-05, third session)

Full plan lives at the session's plan-mode output (see chat history); scope decisions confirmed with the user: renamed files flatten into the archive root, random-hex names, object-data path fields found via the generic `type == "model"/"icon"` meta classification, sound files excluded from v1 (`Sounds::save()` is a no-op stub and `Sounds::load()` even discards some fields today — separate, unrelated work), `war3mapSkin.txt` excluded (already in `Imports::blacklist`, HiveWE doesn't parse it).

Shipped this session:
- `bool ProtectionOptions::obfuscate_asset_paths` + a new "Asset Path Obfuscation" checkbox/group in `map_protector.cpp`, wired through all 4 existing touch points (`collect_options()`, `set_options_enabled()`, `load_settings()`/`save_settings()`).
- New module `src/map_protector/asset_obfuscation.ixx`: `asset_match_key()` (mirrors `unused_files.cpp`'s `match_key` lambda), `is_stock_override_path()` (mirrors the same file's override-root check), `RenameCandidate` struct, and `enumerate_rename_candidates(temp_dir, never_rename_file_names, is_stock_asset)` — walks `temp_dir`, excludes blacklisted/stock-override/stock-resolving files, generates unique flat random-hex names preserving extension. `is_stock_asset` is an injectable predicate (production passes `hierarchy.game_file_exists`) so the function stays testable without touching the global `Hierarchy` singleton.
- `run_async_pack()` calls `enumerate_rename_candidates()` when the option is enabled (proves the module wiring/build end-to-end) but currently always fails the export with an explanatory message — no rewrite/rename logic exists yet, so actually renaming files now would ship a map with dangling references. This is intentional, not a placeholder bug.
- 6 new doctest cases in `tests/asset_obfuscation_test.cpp` (registered in `tests/CMakeLists.txt`) covering blacklist/override/stock-asset exclusion and unique-flat-name generation. Full suite: same pre-existing 5 failures in `object_data_io_test.cpp` (predate this work), no new failures.

**Architectural question raised and resolved:** Phase 2 (object-data SLK field rewriting) needs a fully set-up template+meta SLK per category, which previously only existed inline inside `Map::load()`. The user's real workflow requires Asset Path Obfuscation to work on an externally-compiled `.w3x` (from a VS Code extension), not just the currently-loaded map — HiveWE also can't reliably open `.w3x` directly today (forces folder-expansion), so the external-source protection path is not optional for them. Decided: **(b) extract a shared loader**, not (a) current-map-only or (c) a second divergent loader.

**Shipped:** new module `src/base/stock_object_data.ixx` (`stock_object_data::load() -> Tables`, one `{data, meta}` `TableSet` per category: units/items/doodads/destructibles/abilities/upgrades/buffs, plus `unit_editor_data` for the Object Editor's UI-only dropdown data). `Map::load()` (`src/base/map/map.ixx`) now calls this and move-assigns the results into the existing global `units_slk`/`units_meta_slk`/etc. (from the `Globals` module) exactly as before — pure code motion, not a logic change. Verified faithful (not just "builds"): every string literal (130) and every `.merge()`/`.add_column()`/`.set_shadow_data()`/`.substitute()`/`.build_meta_map()` call (111), extracted via `grep`, matches the pre-refactor code exactly in count and order — the only diff is the variable qualification (`units_meta_slk` → `tables.units.meta`). Full test suite: same pre-existing 5 failures in `object_data_io_test.cpp`, no new failures. **Not verified:** an actual in-app "open a map, check Object Editor" pass — no GUI automation tooling exists in this environment for a native Qt desktop app (no pywinauto/FlaUI harness, no CLI flag to auto-open a map). Recommend a quick manual check (open any map, confirm unit/item/ability data still populates normally in the Object Editor) before relying on this further, though the diff-based verification above is a stronger correctness signal than a screenshot would have been.

Phase 2 itself (actually walking `stock_object_data::load()`'s tables to classify `model`/`icon` fields and rewrite them) is still not built — this session only lands the prerequisite both protection paths can share.

**Phase 2 shipped** (same session, after the user manually verified the `stock_object_data` extraction above by opening a real map and checking the Object Editor/saving worked normally):

- `rewrite_object_data_file()` (exported from `asset_obfuscation.ixx`, not file-local, specifically so it's unit-testable against small hand-built SLKs without needing real game data through Hierarchy) rewrites `model`/`icon`-typed fields in a single object-data modification file: loads it via `extract_modification_shadow_map_path()`, classifies every field via `field_to_meta_id()` + the meta SLK's `type` column (same mechanism `src/models/table_model.ixx`'s `field_type()` already uses for the live Object Editor UI), rewrites any whose value match-keys to a candidate, and re-saves via `shadow_map_to_slk()` + `save_modification_file()` only if something actually changed.
- `rewrite_object_data_references()` orchestrates this across all 7 categories + their `war3mapSkin.*` counterparts, loading its own independent copy of the stock tables via `stock_object_data::load()` (not the live map's) and redirecting `hierarchy.map_directory` to `temp_dir` for the duration, same pattern as `sanitize_metadata()`.
- 3 new tests (hand-built meta/template SLKs + `build_modification_file_buffer()`/`extract_modification_shadow_map_path()` round-trip, no real game data needed): a model-typed field gets rewritten while a same-value string-typed field on the same object doesn't (proves type-gating works, not just presence-matching), a non-matching value is left untouched, and a missing file is a no-op success. Full suite: 32 passed, same pre-existing 5 failures, no regressions.
- **Deliberately not wired into `run_async_pack()` yet.** Until Phase 6 (verification + the actual physical file rename) exists, enabling this would rewrite object-data fields to point at names that don't exist on disk yet, which is worse than doing nothing - the "not implemented, aborts the export" message from Phase 0/1 stays in place until the full enumerate → rewrite-all-reference-kinds → verify → rename chain can run atomically in one pipeline step.

**Phase 3 shipped** (`war3map.w3i`): `rewrite_map_info_references()` rewrites `loading_screen_model`/`prologue_screen_model` if either matches a candidate, reusing the exact `MapInfo` load/tileset-byte/save pattern already implemented twice in `protection_pipeline.ixx`. No dedicated automated test - this is a thin reuse of an already-proven pattern (validated in production by this session's earlier TRIGSTR-in-w3i fix), and the fields it touches (`loading_screen_model`/`prologue_screen_model`) aren't exercised by the object-data test fixtures already in place; covered instead by Phase 6's eventual end-to-end verification.

**Phase 4 shipped** (MDX-internal paths): `rewrite_mdx_references()` walks every `.mdx` under `temp_dir` directly via plain file I/O (no `Hierarchy` needed - these are always loose files already physically present in `temp_dir`), rewrites `Texture::file_name`/`Attachment::path`/`ParticleEmitter1::path` fields that match a candidate, and re-serializes via `to_mdx(model.version)` - explicitly passing the model's own parsed version rather than `to_mdx()`'s `LATEST_MDX_VERSION` default, so an untouched model doesn't get its version silently bumped as a side effect of an unrelated rename elsewhere in the same file. Deliberately does not call `MDX::validate()` (that's for editor-authored models being exported and can restructure the model, e.g. add a bone if none exist - out of scope for a pure rename pass). 2 new tests reusing the `minimal_v1000.mdl` fixture already shared with `mdl_reader_test.cpp` (it ships one texture, `Textures/Stone.blp`): a matching texture gets rewritten and the version is preserved; a non-matching candidate leaves the file byte-for-byte untouched. Full suite: 34 passed, same pre-existing 5 failures, no regressions.

**Phase 5 shipped** (script literals): `rewrite_script_asset_references()` (`protection_pipeline.ixx`, since `find_string_literals()`/`escape_script_string()` already live there and can't be imported into `AssetObfuscation` without a circular module dependency) reuses the same JASS/Lua-aware literal scanner built for TRIGSTR inlining, but unlike TRIGSTR resolution a non-matching literal isn't an error - most string literals aren't paths. A new `unescape_script_string()` (inverse of `escape_script_string()`) was needed and is the one genuinely new/risky piece of this phase: a literal's raw source content is still escaped (a real path separator appears as the two-character sequence `\\`), so comparing it against a candidate's `match_key` without unescaping first would mismatch every backslash. 5 new tests cover the escape/unescape round-trip specifically (including the exact "escaped double-backslash must resolve to one real backslash and still match-key correctly" property), a matching literal getting rewritten while an unrelated literal is left alone, no-match leaving the file untouched, and a commented-out reference correctly *not* being rewritten (proves comment-skipping still works for this use).

**Phase 6 shipped** (verification safety net + physical rename + full wiring): `verify_no_dangling_text_references()` re-scans every `.txt`/`.ini`/`.j`/`.lua` file under `temp_dir` after all four rewrite phases have run, for any leftover occurrence of a candidate's *original* path - deliberately scoped to text-like files only, not a blind byte-scan of every binary asset (binary asset content was already exhaustively covered by the structured MDX phase or simply can't reference another file's path; scanning every byte of every multi-MB import on a large map for no realistic gain was rejected). This is what catches `war3mapSkin.txt` specifically - it can legitimately hold path overrides but nothing in this codebase parses it, so it's excluded from the candidate pool and never rewritten, meaning a reference to a renamed file living only there would otherwise go undetected. `apply_renames()` physically renames every candidate via `fs::rename`, and must run strictly last. `run_asset_obfuscation()` in `protection_pipeline.ixx` orchestrates all of it - enumerate → object data → w3i → MDX → script → verify → rename - short-circuiting on the first failure (originally written as a range-for over a pre-built list of results, which was caught and fixed before landing: that shape evaluates every step regardless of an earlier failure, since the initializer list itself is built eagerly before the loop's first `success` check ever runs). Wired into `run_async_pack()`, replacing the "not implemented" stub from Phase 0/1; runs before `strip_trigger_strings_step()` since both steps can touch `war3map.j`/`war3map.lua`. UI tooltip updated to drop the "not yet implemented" wording. 5 new tests for `verify_no_dangling_text_references()`/`apply_renames()` (text-format leak caught, binary files correctly ignored even when bytes coincidentally match, physical rename works, partial-rename-on-failure behavior documented). Full suite: 44 passed, same pre-existing 5 failures, no regressions. `HiveWE.exe` also rebuilds clean.

**Not covered by an automated test**: `run_asset_obfuscation()`'s full end-to-end orchestration. It transitively calls `stock_object_data::load()` (via `rewrite_object_data_references()`), which needs real stock game data (`Units/UnitData.slk` etc.) resolved through `Hierarchy` - `tests/test_main.cpp` never initializes `Hierarchy` with a real game path, so this can only be exercised by the real `HiveWE.exe` app (which does initialize it), not the test binary. Every phase this orchestrates *is* independently unit-tested against hand-built fixtures that don't need real game data - what's untested is specifically the "does it correctly chain all five phases against a real map's real stock data" integration, which needs a real in-app run.

## Status: critical bug found and fixed via real-map testing (2026-08-06, fourth session)

First real in-app test against the user's actual map (`NCOW_Arena.w3x`, protected via the external-source/"Map file or folder" path) found total breakage: black loading screen, every custom UI element showing as a missing-texture green box. Ladik's MPQ Editor confirmed files were genuinely renamed and core files kept their real names, so the rename/pack mechanics themselves weren't in question - something upstream of the four rewrite phases was wrong.

**Root cause, confirmed by directly inspecting the protected archive** (extracted via a throwaway `mpq::MPQ` test, not guessed): `unpack_source_archive()` - the function that unpacks an external `.w3x` source into `temp_dir` before any Asset Path Obfuscation runs - has **no `(listfile)`** in `NCOW_Arena.w3x` (confirmed: 4014/4014 unpacked files came back under StormLib-fabricated names like `File00001234.blp`, not their real names). This is a *pre-existing* gap, already documented in this same doc's "Prerequisite fix" section from an earlier session ("custom-imported assets under non-core names... still can't be recovered... this is exactly what removing the listfile is supposed to achieve") - but that session only worked around it for the fixed `Imports::blacklist` set of ~29 core filenames. Every custom asset (thousands of them) was extracted under a garbage name with zero relation to what the script/object-data/models actually reference. `enumerate_rename_candidates()` then built candidates from *those* garbage names, so nothing in the four rewrite phases ever matched a real reference - meanwhile the real-named assets those references depend on had already been scattered under meaningless names and then renamed *again*, orphaning them completely. Not a bug in the rewrite logic itself (verified independently via 33 passing unit tests) - every candidate it was ever given was already disconnected from reality before Asset Path Obfuscation started.

**Fix:** `war3map.imp` - the standard WC3 import manifest (written by the World Editor, HiveWE, and evidently the user's own external build pipeline too) - already lists every custom import's real path. Confirmed present and populated in the user's archive (168KB, 3982 entries) via the same diagnostic test. `unpack_source_archive()` now parses it (`parse_import_manifest_paths()`, matching `Imports::save()`'s binary format exactly: `u32` version, `u32` count, then per-entry `u8` flag + null-terminated path) and re-extracts every listed file by its real name via the existing listfile-independent `MPQ::extract_file()` (name-hash lookup, doesn't need a listfile). Verified directly against the real broken case: 3981/3982 manifest entries recovered by real name, including the specific texture (`UI\NCOW_UI_BarRedRiffled.blp`) confirmed missing in-game. This fixes the *whole* external-source protection path, not just Asset Path Obfuscation - any Map Protector option using a listfile-less source `.w3x` was silently at risk of this before.

**Update: the "harmless leftover" call above was wrong - root-caused and fixed the error-87 crash too, same session.** Reproduced directly against the real archive via a standalone `SFileAddFileEx` repro (not guessed): the *same file bytes* succeed when added under a normal name but fail with `ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER` (87) under **any** name matching the pattern `File` + exactly 8 digits + `.` + extension (tested with two different digit sequences, both failed identically) - this is StormLib's own reserved placeholder for "no real name available" (exactly what `MPQ::unpack()`'s wildcard enumeration produces for every entry in a listfile-less archive), and `SFileAddFileEx` unconditionally refuses to re-add anything under that exact pattern, regardless of content. So the stale fabricated-name duplicates weren't just wasteful clutter - they made packing crash outright, deterministically, for *any* map with a listfile-less source, independent of every other Map Protector option (matches the user's report that a bare-minimum export with everything off still failed).

**Fix:** new `is_stormlib_fabricated_name()` in `protection_pipeline.ixx`, checked in `run_async_pack()`'s packing loop - any file matching the pattern is skipped (never added to the output archive) rather than attempted and crashing the whole export. Real-named copies of these files are already separately recovered via `war3map.imp` where possible (the fix above); anything left over under a fabricated name was never going to pack successfully anyway, so skipping it converts a guaranteed export failure into a clean export missing only that one untraceable file. 6 new unit tests (StormLib's exact pattern plus deliberate near-misses: 7 digits, 9 digits, no extension, empty extension after the dot, a normal filename that merely starts with "File").

**Update: with both fixes above landed, the user hit a real editor *crash* (not a graceful error) specifically when the obfuscation checkbox was checked - export without it worked.** Root-caused and fixed, same session:

- **Actual root cause: `slk::SLK::copy_row()` had a self-referential insert-and-copy bug** (`base_data[new_row_header] = base_data.at(row_header);`) - `base_data` is a flat hash map (`hive::unordered_map`/`ankerl::unordered_dense`), so the `operator[]` insert on the left can reallocate the map's backing storage and invalidate the reference `.at()` returned on the right *before* the assignment reads from it. This is undefined behavior, not a clean throw, which is why it manifested as an actual crash rather than a catchable exception - confirmed directly with a unit test: the buggy code copied an *empty* row into the new entry instead of the real data. Fixed by copying the source row out by value into a local first, then inserting - same fix applied to the parallel `shadow_data[new_row_header] = shadow_data.at(row_header);` line right below it, which has the identical shape. Grepped the rest of the codebase for the same `map[new_key] = map.at(other_key)` pattern - one other hit (`slk.ixx:177`) is safe because both keys already exist there (no insert, no reallocation risk).
- `copy_row()` is called from `shadow_map_to_slk()` whenever a custom object's `oldid` parent needs inheriting - exactly the code path `rewrite_object_data_file()` (Asset Path Obfuscation's Phase 2) exercises for the first time in production, which is why this had never surfaced before despite being pre-existing, shared code (also used by `object_data_io.ixx`'s validation path).
- **Also fixed, defense in depth**: `shadow_map_to_slk()`'s guard for calling `copy_row()` checked `row_headers.contains(parent) || base_data.contains(parent)`, but `copy_row()` itself only needs (and asserts) `base_data.contains(parent)` - a row can exist in `row_headers` without a `base_data` entry (e.g. a header declared with no cell data), so the OR let a real map trigger `base_data.at()` throwing `std::out_of_range` in the case the memory bug above didn't already occur first. Tightened to match `copy_row()`'s actual precondition.
- **Also fixed, defense in depth**: `run_asset_obfuscation()` in `protection_pipeline.ixx` now wraps its entire body in try/catch. It runs on `run_async_pack()`'s background `QThread`, where an exception escaping the thread's entry point is unrecoverable (`std::terminate()`, the whole app crashes) - any *future* throw from object data/SLK/MDX parsing on data this pipeline hasn't been exercised against yet now fails that one export gracefully instead of taking the editor down with it. This wouldn't have caught the actual bug above (that was memory corruption, not an exception), but it's still real, warranted hardening for a background-thread pipeline that had none before.
- 2 new `shadow_map_to_slk` tests in `modification_tables_test.cpp` (the missing-base_data-entry case that previously threw; a positive case confirming inherited fields actually copy through correctly - this second test is what caught the memory bug in the first place, by asserting on the *copied value*, not just "did it throw").

**Update: crash confirmed fixed - re-test surfaced one more real, narrower issue, also fixed.** With the `copy_row()` fix live, the same `NCOW_Arena.w3x` export no longer crashed; instead it cleanly aborted with `'desktop.ini' still references 'B008.tga', which is not a reference kind this pipeline rewrites`. This is `verify_no_dangling_text_references()` working exactly as designed - but the file it flagged, `desktop.ini`, is Windows Explorer's folder-customization metadata (folder icon settings), not WC3 map data. It apparently got swept into the map's files incidentally (the source folder had a custom folder icon set at some point) and happened to reference one of the renamed textures by its old path in an `IconResource=` line. The engine never opens `desktop.ini` regardless of content, so aborting over it was correct-by-the-verification-pass's-own-rules but wrong for gameplay purposes.

**Fix**: new `is_os_metadata_filename()` in `asset_obfuscation.ixx` (currently just `desktop.ini`, matched case-insensitively) - excluded from both `enumerate_rename_candidates()` (pointless to rename something the game never opens) and `verify_no_dangling_text_references()`'s scan (a stale reference inside one isn't a real problem). 2 new tests. Full suite: 49 passed, same 5 pre-existing unrelated failures.

**Update: desktop.ini fix confirmed working - re-test against the real "release mode" build (`release.w3x`, the user's actual VS Code extension output, not a stale copy) surfaced one more real, genuine gap, also fixed.** Export aborted with `'war3map.lua' still references 'NCOW_SFX_CrackGroundBreakChibakuHQQ.mdx'`. Traced directly against the real source (extracted `war3map.imp` + `war3map.lua` via a throwaway `mpq::MPQ` test, same approach as every other fix this session): the reference is real, e.g. `EffectEx():onPoint('NCOW_SFX_CrackGroundBreakChibakuHQQ.mdx',cB.x,cB.y,0)` - a **single-quoted** Lua string literal. `find_string_literals()` (built for TRIGSTR inlining, reused by Asset Path Obfuscation's script-rewrite phase) only ever recognized double-quoted (`"..."`) strings, so it silently never saw these literals at all - not a false positive, a real miss the verification pass correctly caught.

**Fix**: `find_string_literals()` now takes an `allow_single_quote_strings` parameter. Both call sites (`strip_trigger_strings_step`, `rewrite_script_asset_references`) pass `true` only for `war3map.lua`, `false` for `war3map.j` - this distinction matters because JASS overloads `'...'` for something completely different: a 4-character rawcode literal (e.g. `'hfoo'`) that compiles to an integer constant, not a string at all. Lua accepts `'...'` and `"..."` interchangeably for strings; JASS does not accept `'...'` as a string in any form. Treating a JASS rawcode as a string would have both misclassified it and risked corrupting the script if a rewrite ever matched one. This same fix also benefits `strip_trigger_strings` (TRIGSTR inlining), which shares the same scanner and had the identical blind spot for any map using single-quoted Lua literals for `TRIGSTR_XXX` references - not yet known to have hit a real map, but the same class of bug either way. 2 new tests: a single-quoted Lua literal gets rewritten; a JASS rawcode that happens to share content with a candidate is left completely untouched. Full suite: 51 passed, same 5 pre-existing unrelated failures.

**Update: single-quote fix confirmed working - next re-test surfaced a genuine bug in the verification pass itself, also fixed.** Export aborted with `'war3mapSkin.txt' still references 'ground.blp'`. Extracted the real `war3mapSkin.txt` directly (same `mpq::MPQ` throwaway-test approach as every fix this session) and found no `ground.blp` reference anywhere in it - what it actually has is `BuildTimeIndicator=UI\Widgets\EscMenu\Human\blank-background.blp`. `"blank-background.blp"` contains `"...ground.blp"` as a pure byte coincidence (back-**ground.blp**), and `verify_no_dangling_text_references()`'s matching was a plain `content.find(needle) != npos` substring search with no word-boundary awareness - a real bug in the verification pass itself, not a case of a file legitimately needing exclusion like `desktop.ini` was.

**Fix**: new `contains_path_reference()` in `asset_obfuscation.ixx` requires the character immediately before and after each candidate occurrence (if any) to not itself be a filename-continuation character (alphanumeric/`_`/`-`) - a path separator, quote, `=`, whitespace, or the start/end of the content all count as valid boundaries. Keeps scanning past a rejected occurrence in case a later one in the same file is a genuine reference, rather than giving up after the first (coincidental) hit. 2 new tests: the exact false-positive shape (`ground.blp` candidate, `blank-background.blp` in the file) now passes; a genuine standalone reference (`GoldIcon=ground.blp`) is still correctly caught. Full suite: 53 passed, same 5 pre-existing unrelated failures.

**Update: export succeeded end to end for the first time - but the protected output was ~1.66x the size of the source (367MB -> 611MB), where every prior successful protection had made the map slightly *smaller*.** Root-caused without needing a repro artifact this time - traced it to an interaction between the last two sessions' own fixes:

- The `war3map.imp` fix (this doc, session 4) recovers real-named copies of custom imports but, deliberately at the time, left the stale StormLib-fabricated-name duplicates (`File00001234.blp` etc.) from `mpq.unpack()`'s wildcard step sitting in `temp_dir` untouched - reasoned to be harmless clutter, since `run_async_pack()`'s packing loop already skips anything matching `is_stormlib_fabricated_name()`.
- That reasoning held only when Asset Path Obfuscation is **off**. With it **on**, `enumerate_rename_candidates()` doesn't know a fabricated-name file is a duplicate (no fabricated-name-to-real-name mapping exists to check against - `MPQ::unpack()` doesn't expose one) - it just sees an ordinary loose file and treats it as a normal rename candidate. `apply_renames()` then renames it to a *new*, non-fabricated-looking hex name (e.g. `File00001234.blp` -> `b7e1d4f0.blp`), which no longer matches `is_stormlib_fabricated_name()`'s pattern - so the pack-time skip that used to exclude it silently stops applying. Every custom asset ends up shipped twice: once under the real asset's own renamed identity, once again under the duplicate's separately-renamed identity.

**Fix**: `unpack_source_archive()` now deletes every file matching `is_stormlib_fabricated_name()` right after the `war3map.imp` recovery pass, instead of leaving them in `temp_dir`. Collected into a list first, then removed in a separate pass (mutating a directory tree mid-`recursive_directory_iterator` is unspecified behavior even when only already-visited entries are removed). `is_stormlib_fabricated_name()` itself moved earlier in the file so `unpack_source_archive()` can call it (was previously defined only where `run_async_pack()`'s packing-loop skip needed it) - the packing-loop skip stays in place as a defense-in-depth backstop. Net effect matches what was already accepted as fine: a file matching this pattern that isn't listed in `war3map.imp` was never going to pack successfully under its fabricated name anyway, so dropping it here has the same outcome as the old skip-at-pack-time behavior, just without the duplication bug. No new automated test - covering this needs a real, listfile-less multi-thousand-file archive, the same category of integration-only case already accepted for `run_asset_obfuscation()`'s full end-to-end chain; verified by code review and awaiting the user's real-world re-test (file size should return to smaller-than-source, matching every export before this one).

**Update: size fixed, but the map crashed on load - root-caused to a real gap in `rewrite_object_data_file()`, not yet root-caused *why*, but a real safety net is now in place.** Size confirmed back to normal (smaller than source). But in-game, Warcraft III crashed with an access violation before the loading screen ever appeared. Bisected with the user's help (obfuscation off -> works fine; obfuscation on -> crashes, everything else identical) to confirm Asset Path Obfuscation specifically, then root-caused via direct archive inspection (same `mpq::MPQ` throwaway-test approach as every fix this session, this time comparing an "on" and "off" export of the same source side by side):

- Ruled out, with direct evidence, in order: the `war3mapSkin.txt`-referenced `CustomSkin` stock icons (confirmed absent from both `war3map.imp` and the archive in *both* exports - genuinely stock, never touched by this pipeline either way); the loading screen model itself (`war3map.w3i`'s `loading_screen_model` correctly rewritten from `LoadingScreen.mdx` to a new name, file exists, valid `MDLX` header, parses cleanly); the loading screen's own internal texture reference (correctly rewritten, resolves in the archive).
- Found via a broader sweep (extract every printable-ASCII run ending in a known asset extension from every object-data/script file in the "on" archive, check each against the archive): several genuine, `war3map.imp`-tracked, archive-present custom imports - confirmed at least `NCOW_SFX_FireBurnTargetHQ.mdx`, `NCOW_SFX_Stunned.mdx`, `NCOW_SFX_AmaterasuMedium.mdx` - are **referenced but missing** specifically via `war3map.w3h` (Ability Buffs). `rewrite_object_data_file()` silently failed to rewrite these fields, even though the underlying files were correctly recovered and would otherwise have been valid rename candidates. **Root cause of the field-classification miss itself is not yet found** - the leading suspect is `field_to_meta_id()`/the meta SLK's `type` column resolving buff SFX fields (`targetart`/`missileart`/`specialart`/`buffart`) differently than expected, but confirming that needs the real `AbilityBuffMetaData.slk` content (real game data via `Hierarchy`/CASC), which isn't available in this session's read-only investigation tooling.
- **Real, separate bug found and fixed along the way**: `verify_no_dangling_text_references()` only ever scanned text-format files (`.txt`/`.ini`/`.j`/`.lua`) - it never scanned the object-data files themselves, so this exact class of miss was invisible to the one safety net meant to catch it. Widened to also scan `.w3u`/`.w3t`/`.w3a`/`.w3b`/`.w3h`/`.w3q`/`.w3d` (the object-data extensions are typically small, unlike the *actual* binary assets - BLP/MDX/WAV - this scan still deliberately excludes). The matching logic (`contains_path_reference()`) is already content-agnostic byte-string matching, so this cost nothing beyond reading a few more small files. 1 new test reproducing the exact real-world shape (a candidate's name embedded in synthetic binary "object data" content, surrounded by non-filename bytes). Full suite: 54 passed, same 5 pre-existing unrelated failures.
- **Net effect for the user right now**: Asset Path Obfuscation on this map will no longer crash the game - it will now correctly *abort the export* with a clear error naming the exact file/field, the same as every other disclosed gap in this pipeline (war3mapSkin.txt, single-quote Lua, etc.). That's strictly better than a silent crash, but the feature still can't successfully complete an export for this specific map until the underlying Phase 2 classification gap is actually fixed.

**Next steps, in order:**
1. Root-cause why buff SFX fields aren't classified as `model`/`icon` by `field_to_meta_id()` - needs real game data access (a session with a live HiveWE instance and real CASC, or the user directly inspecting `AbilityBuffMetaData.slk`'s `type` column for the `targetart`/`missileart`/`specialart`/`buffart` rows).
2. Once fixed, re-run the exact failing case and confirm: export succeeds, output is smaller than source, loading screen and custom UI render correctly, SFX/effects (including single-quoted Lua ones) play correctly, and specifically the buffs that were broken (Stunned, AmaterasuMedium, FireBurnTargetHQ, Chidori) show their correct effects.
3. Also re-run a bare-minimum export (everything off) to confirm the error-87 crash is gone.
4. Ladik's MPQ Editor: confirm renamed files still don't resolve to recognizable names.
5. Combined with `strip_trigger_strings`/`encrypt_files`/`inject_junk_files` together.

### On classic-era file renaming/obfuscation (discussed, not implemented)

The user asked how old map protectors renamed every file (including BLPs) to things like `File002591294921` while keeping the map playable. Mechanically: it's possible because everything WC3 loads by path — model paths in `war3map.doo`, unit/item art paths in `war3unit.doo`/object data, terrain textures in `war3map.w3e`, icon/portrait paths in the SLK-derived meta tables, etc. — is just a string, and the engine doesn't care what that string looks like as long as every reference to a given asset is rewritten to the *same* new name consistently. The catch: WC3 itself hardcodes the small set of `war3map.*`/`war3campaign.*` core filenames it looks up directly by name (these can never be renamed), but everything else — every custom import — is fair game if (and only if) every cross-reference to it, across every binary format that can mention a path, is rewritten in lockstep. That's a large, error-prone surface (this repo's Phase 3 notes already flag "custom object ID remapping" as similarly complex/deferred, for the same reason: many places to update, one miss silently breaks something). Not started; would need its own scoped pass through every format that stores an asset path before it's safe to build.
